Our projects serve people in two ways:

- **As they’re starting**, it gives them clear, actionable entry points to begin
  tinkering with useful tools and languages

- **As they’re growing**, it gives them a place they can revisit to renew and
  deepen their understanding of the tools they’re using

## Our Role

\[We make choices about which technologies we use and talk about using
these criteria:

- Tools should be modern and be valid industry practice that is still useful to
  people
- We focus on the TypeScript language and ecosystem because \[\[reasons\]\]

\]

## Our Entry Points

\[One of the goals of the FujoVerse™ is to create projects that entice and
encourage people to take up programming, and FujoGuide is meant to be the answer
as to how they can do that\]

- \[BobaBoard can funnel people into learning collaborative and self-reliant
  tools\]
- \[Our NPM libraries encourage people to learn how to use NPM or get bolder
  with their Astro websites\]
- \[Fandom Coders …\]

# **Writing Style**

This guide is here to create a consistent style our readers can come to trust and learn from. At all times, we must balance technical knowledge with the casual, friendly banter of hobby spaces.

When writing for FujoGuide, **think of yourself as a knowledgeable friend**, rather than a formal instructor. You are deeply invested in the reader’s success, have a strong belief in their abilities, and yet relate to their present struggles—you too have been an *intimidated beginner* once\!

## **Tone and Voice**

Your tone should balance credibility and approachability by being:

**Practical & Instructional:** 

* Set clear expectations for the reader and stick to what you’ve outlined.  
* Keep steps simple: one action per step.  
* Action and consequences should be clearly labeled and follow logically.  
* Write with the expectation that your reader is following along with your instructions, so don’t lead them to a metaphorical cliff without warning clearly that the risk is there

| Do | Do not |
|-----|-----|
|<ul><li>Focus on the *hows* and the necessary *whys.*</li> <li>State prerequisites clearly and explain how to fulfill them.</li> <li>Highlight the value of what you’re sharing (“a good git config will save you future pain!”, “Using a terminal will unlock new useful tools!”).</li> <li>Give accurate explanations.</li> <li>Use consistent terminology.</li> <li>Provide clear steps and examples.</li> <li>Call out potential traps and warn appropriately before giving the instruction.</li> <li>Keep warnings and other callouts relevant: it’s okay to give a heads up for the next step, but a warning for seven steps ahead might get lost and not be as effective.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Downplay your expertise.</li> <li>Assume previous knowledge without stating your assumptions clearly.</li> <li>Be unnecessarily pedantic: it’s okay to omit corner cases when they don’t provide value.</li> <li>Give open-ended instructions that could lead them to a trap.</li> <li>Skip steps: assume your reader is doing what you’re telling them for the first time ever.</li></ul>|

**Approachable & Conversational:** 

* Your reader should feel spoken to, not lectured at.  
* The occasional meme or inside joke to break the tension is welcome, as long as it doesn’t derail the flow of information.  
* Keep the wording simple and accessible.  
* Don't be afraid of teaching people technical jargon when appropriate, but make sure to define it clearly in approachable terms.

| Do | Do not |
|-----|-----|
|<ul><li>Talk directly to the reader using you/your.</li> <li>Use contractions like you’ll, it’s, don’t, etc.</li> <li>Use clear and direct language.</li> <li>Use simple words and sentence structures.</li> <li>Use accurate terminology.</li> <li>Introduce acronyms the first time you use them.</li> </ul>|<ul><li>Sound condescending: be *very* careful with obviously, simply, just, etc. Use them to encourage, not to devalue.</li> <li>Use academic or jargon terms that hobbyists won’t encounter in practice, unless appropriate for an aside.</li> <li>Force analogies that oversimplify concepts without adding real value.</li> <li>Come across as “talking down” to the audience.</li> </ul>|

**Empathetic & Reassuring:** 

* Remember, friends helping friends is the goal.  
* Our audience comes to us for help, trusting that we won’t judge them for struggling, and we’ll do our best to answer in a way they can understand.  
* Our goal is to empower our audience to use this knowledge in their own projects.

| Do | Do not |
|-----|-----|
|<ul><li>Acknowledge difficulties (“this part can be tricky”, “it’s normal to struggle with”, etc.).</li> <li>Give encouragement and support (“take a deep breath”, “you got this\!”, “It might seem hard, but you will master it\!”).</li> <li>Demystify people’s beliefs about experts and expert spaces (“Professionals are always looking up stuff”, “the terminal/shell terminology is not used consistently”, “many programmers don’t know how to exit Vim”).</li> <li>Encourage the reader to master skills by providing examples of what they can use them for. (“Once you master this, you will be able to do…”)</li> </ul> |<ul><li>Omit potential roadblocks or downplay their impact.</li> <li>Point out problems without offering solutions or at least pointing to external sources to resolve it.</li> <li>Catastrophize: be clear and precise about the possible challenges or mistakes that readers can make, and offer specific actions to prevent them.</li></ul>|

**Genuine & Empowering:** 

* There’s no single right way of doing things: what we offer is a specific option.  
* Our ulterior motive is to unlock coding as a path for self-expression, not to dictate what that self-expression should look like.  
* Avoid hierarchical speech: we’re all peers helping each other.  
* We do this because we *genuinely* love technology and the possibilities it unlocks, and want our friends to love it and use it too.

| Do | Do not |
|-----|-----|
|<ul><li>Use light humor if it fits naturally.</li> <li>References are okay if they’re both timeless and do not alienate outsiders.</li> <li>Help people dream about future possibilities that their new knowledge will unlock.</li> <li>Think back to your personal experiences, fears and frustrations, and use them to generate human warmth in the content.</li></ul>|<ul><li>Try too hard to be funny.</li> <li>Imply there’s a unique or uniform learning path.</li> <li>Imply there’s a single way to be an expert.</li> <li>Make the reader feel they’re not part of the group because they don’t understand a reference.</li></ul>|

## **Language Conventions**

The following conventions help us craft effective explanations that are easy to parse and absorb. These rules aren’t meant to be prescriptive, but are a starting point to craft sentences from, and a tool to review them with:

* **Language Standard:**   
  * Stick to standard American English.   
  * Online parlance is welcome when appropriate.   
  * Be mindful of slang that can be misconstrued as aggressive, negative or hurtful.  
  * Use inclusive, neutral language.  
  * Avoid making readers feel ostracized because they don’t understand the references or jokes.  
  * Hate speech has no place in our work.  
  * Do not make people or categories of people the butt of the joke.

* **Language Clarity:**   
  * Prioritize direct, unambiguous writing.  
  * Use language well:  
    * Prefer an active voice to be more direct, clear, and engaging—unless it makes a simple explanation convoluted!  
    * Cut unnecessary words (“`in order to => to`”)  
    * Prefer strong verbs over nouns (“`perform an installation => install`”)  
    * Prefer positive framing when you’re not giving an explicit warning (“`Don’t do [x] unless [y] => if [y] do [x]`”)  
    * Use transition words to smooth connections between sentences and paragraphs.
  * Get to the point quickly:  
    * When introducing a concept, start with a straightforward definition (“`Git is a program to manage changes to your files…`”, “`Absolute file paths specify the file location starting from the root…`, “`Commands are instructions you give to your Terminal…`”)  
    * When explaining how to achieve a goal, prefer stating the goal first (“`To install a new library, you can run npm add [x]`”, “`To know the directory you’re currently in, use the pwd command`”)  
  * Break down complex ideas in multiple sentences and paragraphs. If a sentence is getting long, consider:  
    * moving the subject or central point closer to the beginning  
    * reframing it as multiple sentences  
    * using bullet points to break it down into parts

* **Economy of Language:**  
  *  Make sure you cover the important parts without long-winded explanations. Respect readers’ time and attention span\!  
  * The main content should prioritize information that is useful (the reader will need it to achieve their goals) and timely (is relevant to what they’re *currently* learning)  
  * If an important explanation doesn’t quite fit, consider whether it can:  
    * be featured in a more appropriate place  
    * grouped with other useful explanations to create a larger topic  
  * Use asides to call out special cases, or to give more advanced explanations most readers can safely skip

* **Purposeful Language:**  
  * **Be consistent:** Use the same terms throughout the article and match the rest of the site–let us know where we got this wrong ourselves\!  
  * **Define key terms:** Clearly define terms and concepts when you first introduce them. Use bold to highlight the core part of the explanation to aid skimmability. Make sure the bold part reads like a sentence\!  
  * **Spell out acronyms:** When you introduce an acronym, explain what it stands for. You can choose whether to use:  
    * **Term (acronym):** if the full term is common or it helps initial understanding (“`A Version Control System (VCS) helps people…`”)  
    * **Acronym (term):** if the acronym is frequently encountered in the wild (“`NPM (Node Package Manager) is a powerful tool that…`”)  
    * **Separate Sentences:** if the expansion requires more context or you want to elaborate on its meaning (“`HTML defines the structure of your websites. Its name stands for HyperText Markup Language, highlighting its ability to…`”)  
  * **Clarify confusion:** explicitly call out terms that are often mixed up (e.g. `terminal program` vs `script` vs `command`) and differences across systems (e.g. `path separators`). When the differences are not important, acknowledge that and, if needed, add further explanations in an aside.  
  * **Avoid filler words:** Remove words that do not add value or clarity to the sentence. If you can say it in five words, don’t say it in ten.

# **Content Formatting**

Our content is designed for *skimmability*: as you write it, imagine you’re only reading bits and pieces of it as you go in search of the sections most relevant to what you’re trying to do.

### **General Formatting**

* Paragraphs:   
  * Keep them short and focused on a single idea.   
  * Be generous with them.  
  * The key idea should be in the first sentence of each paragraph. Follow up sentences provide additional context/information.

* Bold:   
  * Use bold to highlight the key big idea in an article, or other crucial concepts. For highlights, try to capture a whole idea. For example: “As one of the most popular Version Control Systems, **Git helps you never lose track of changes to your code**, no matter how long it’s been since you last worked on it\!”  
    * How much of the sentence to highlight is a bit of an art\! As a general rule, highlight the one thing that you’d want the reader to take away from the article after they finish reading it.  
    * Make sure not to bold too often in a row, as it can get overwhelming and lose effectiveness. If you find yourself with multiple key big ideas, you should consider if they would be better served by being separated into their own article each. This also applies to sections and paragraphs, too.   
* Italics:  
  * Group together longer titles without using “” (e.g. These articles are designed as companions to *FujoGuide Issue 1: Local Version Control with Git*, which you can buy…)  
  * Stress important points in sentences, e.g. pay *very close* attention to the path you give to the `rm` command. Similar to bold, you should not emphasize every other word in a sentence. If there are multiple important points in a single sentence, consider breaking them up into their unique paragraph to better space them out.

* DFN  
  * Use DFN tag to highlight technical terms that aren’t code commands (e.g. In coding, it’s often useful to use **relative paths** for files and directories).

* Linking:   
  * Use links generously, and make sure you’re linking descriptive text (not “`click here`” but “`find the official documentation here`”).   
  * You should link to:  
    * Relevant articles from elsewhere on `learn.fujoweb.dev`, especially for prerequisites, terms definitions, or deeper knowledge  
    * Authoritative external sources (e.g. `MDN`, official tool docs)  
    * If we don’t have a guide, we might try to find a good substitute on the web. However, these links tend to rot.

* Lists:   
  * Use lists generously, as they help with skimmability.   
  * You should:  
    * Use numbered lists for items in sequence (e.g. we’ll learn 1\) how to do A 2\) how to do B…)  
    * Use bullet point lists for key takeaways or items not in a sequence (like this list\!)  
    * Use [Steps](https://starlight.astro.build/components/steps/) for sequences of instructions

### **Code Formatting**

* Inline Code: We use inline code to highlight:  
  * Commands (e.g. `git commit -m “your message”`)  
  * File names (`index.html`), paths `~/my_site/`, keyboard shortcuts (`ctrl + k`) or tool names (`vim`, `zsh`)  
* Code blocks: Code blocks are an essential part of our guides, as they help people see how things work *in practice* and help break the flow of the text (and aid in skimmability). You should:  
  * Make sure to explain what the code does and why it’s there.
  * Provide both input and output (unless confusing). You can omit part of the output if it helps the user focus on what you want to see. Similarly, you can make some output lighter to de-emphasize it.  
  * Use the code block captions to call out any particular element of the example you want the user to notice.

### **Other Formatting**

Images: 

* Use images to show non-code results, UIs, or examples of programs in action. You can annotate if needed, but be mindful that it makes them harder to edit later.  
* If you cannot provide ALT text yourself, let us know: we’ll get someone to write it for you.  
* Use captions to help the reader understand what they’re looking at and what matters about it.

Diagrams:

* [We use Excalidraw for diagrams](https://excalidraw.com/).   
* Make sure you download the `.excalidraw` file and not just the PNG.

Tabs: 

* When a command differs across programs or Operating Systems, you can use [Tabs](https://starlight.astro.build/components/tabs/) to provide alternative versions of commands or explanations.

**More components:** we can easily use [all components from Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/components/steps/). If you think a specific functionality not covered by these would help, you can ask Ms Boba whether it can be provided.

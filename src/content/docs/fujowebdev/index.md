Clear and approachable learning content for beginner-to-intermediate hobbyist
web developers that is:

- **Practical**, helping _hobbyists_ who want to hit the ground running get
  started quickly
- **Foundational**, clarifying concepts _hobbyists’_ guides gloss over to make
  advanced tools accessible
- **Encouraging**, deeply believing in the reader's ability to learn complex
  subjects…
- **Validating**, …while acknowledging the real struggles (and joys) of learning
  web development

But, above all:

- <u>**Empowering**</u>, framing learning not as a chore, but as a tool to
  reclaim a sense of control over the web and its endless possibilities of
  creative expression and human connection

## Our Audience

Hobbyist web developers that aren’t (necessarily) building a coding career, but
are drawn to the creative and practical possibilities of programming—especially
when it comes to building tools for themselves and their communities.

We assume they:

- **Have already taken (basic) steps into programming**, but may be running
  commands or copy-pasting code they don’t fully understand
- **Are overwhelmed by the many paths and topics out there**, and are looking
  for guidance on where to go next
- **Are stuck in a learning limbo**, caught between hobbyist learning material
  they outgrew, and hard-to-parse professional guides that don’t speak to their
  needs

:::note[Audience Demographic]

As we write, we primarily imagine an audience that is:

- **Very online**, aware of online memes and parlance
- **Millennial**, coming online around the 00s-10s period (or wishing they had)
- **Nostalgic**, of a time when the internet didn’t take itself so seriously and
  possibilities felt endless
- **Unapologetically passionate**, not afraid of being seen as “cringe” as they
  dive deep into their interests

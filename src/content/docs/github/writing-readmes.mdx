title: How to write READMEs
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

:::caution

We extracted these principles from Ms Boba's feedback while we were working on
the Authproto README. They're very much a WIP and subject to change.

:::

## Before you start writing

- We write our READMEs to be approachable to hobbyists. Keep your words simple,
  but it's ok to make assumptions about the technologies they know.
- Our libraries are often useful to advanced developers too. Make sure there
  are sections that speak more directly to their language and needs. Help them
  skip over basic explanations they don't need to go to what interests them.

## Sections

### Intro

- Project banner
- Few words description of what the library does
- Technologies used and other badges

## About this library

### What does `[library-name]` do?

- Simple explanation (couple short sentence) for a fannish person stumbling upon
  the repo.
- A few more sentences that mention technical terms so experienced folks can
  pattern-match and really understand if it does what they seek.
- Make sure you namedrop and link to the relevant technologies. For example,
  if it's an Astro Integration, make sure you link to Astro.

### Inside you'll find...

- A quick list of the major components of this library. Once again, make sure
  it's understandable to a hobbyist for whom the library is relevant.

### What can you build with `[library-name]`?

Alternatively: What can you do with `[library-name]`?

- Think about the major categories of applications that the library enables, building
  from the simplest cases, to those that require more configurations.
- List items should state the general concept first, then go into practical examples.
  For example, "read the data on a visitor's PDS, so you can create comment sections,
  or guestbooks, or..."

## How to use `[library-name]`

If we have examples, this may be a good place to add a note like "learn better
with examples? Skip directly to the examples section (link) or look for them in
[`folder/path`] (link)

### Prerequisites

- Anything the library assumes is already there. For example, make sure your Astro
  site is configured, that it has server mode, and have Astro sessions enabled.
- If we have any guide that would help getting folks started, this is a good
  place to link to them.

### Installation & Requirements

- The install command. We should use `npm` and assume everyone who's using a
  different one is aware they can use another.
- If other special libraries must be installed, this is also a place to mention
  them.
- If a library should already be installed by the time a user finds a use for
  the library, it would go in pre-requisites instead.

### Configuring `[library-name]`

Start with easy to follow steps:

- Quick steps needed for the base configuration, in numbered bullet points
- You don't have to show everything that's possible, just do a quick
  list for the minimum required setup
- Try not to skip steps. If something needs e.g. importing, mention it
- If choices need to be made, give a quick explanation of what they are
  and influence, and a reccommendation to get started
- You can add optional steps for common use cases

Then do a full example:

- Finish with an example, as copy/pastable then easy to fill
  as possible. For example, prefer writing `"your_string_here"` to
  just leaving a comment, so someone who copy pastes can just double
  click and replace.
- In the example, you can reiterate minimum requirements and
  choices to be made using comments
- The example should be simple, but you can add configuration options
  if it helps illustrate what's possible, even if they're not required.

At the end, redirect to a configuration section (or site) for further
options. You can tease what those options will enable, so folks know
whether it's worth going there.

If there are multiple independent sections (e.g. configure the client
and then configure the server), you should split those up in their own
subsections.

### Using `[library-name]`

- Note that to see this in action, people can go directly to the
  example folder
- Start by highlighting things you get out of the box
- If there are more involved usages, create subsections with descriptive
  titles
- Make sure you redirect users to practical examples throughout (link
  directly to the appropriate lines)

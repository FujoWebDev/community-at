## What is Community@?

Community@ is the community hub for [FujoCoded](https://fujocoded.com) and the
rest of the FujoVerse™. In this _very_ work in progress website, you'll find
everything from our resources on collective governance
([Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)), documentations for our
software libraries, and internal—but, we hope, _useful_—guides that everyone
can see and take inspiration from.
